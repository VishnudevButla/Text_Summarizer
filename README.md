# 📝 Text Summarizer Web Application

## 🚀 Overview  
A lightweight web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer-based models to generate **abstractive summaries** of long-form text. Built with Python and Flask, it delivers real-time summarization via Hugging Face’s T5 model, ideal for digesting articles, essays, and reports.

## ✨ Features
- 🌐 **Frontend**: Simple and responsive HTML/CSS interface (no JavaScript).
- 🧠 **Backend**: Flask API integrated with the pre-trained `t5-small` transformer model.
- ⚡ **Summary Engine**: Uses beam search to generate coherent and fluid summaries.
- 📚 **Use Cases**: Tailored for academic, journalistic, and professional content summarization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Flask  
- Hugging Face Transformers (T5)  
- PyTorch  
- HTML5 & CSS3  

## 🧩 Why It Stands Out  
Unlike extractive summarizers that copy key sentences, this tool uses an **abstractive approach**—rephrasing input text to create truly natural, readable summaries that reflect deeper understanding and context.
